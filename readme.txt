What is a Rich Snippet?
Rich Snippets is the term used to describe structured data markup that site operators can add to their existing HTML, which in turn allow search engines to better understand what information is contained on each web page. See example on our blog : <a href="http://www.bloggersideas.com/how-to-make-product-review-site-with-wordpress-to-make-money/">Usage of SchemaNinja</a>
How does a Rich Snippet help?
It gives search engines only the important & precise information to display in search result snippets.

Rich Snippets are very interactive (photos, star ratings, price, author, etc.) to let you stand out from competition on SERPï¿½s. There are high chances that users will click more on Schema results than non schema results.
